# Moodify

Moodify is a Python script that analyzes a user's Spotify listening history and generates a customized playlist based on the user's top tracks played over the week. The script utilizes Spotify's API to access the user's listening data and algorithm to analyze the data and determine the user's top played tracks. The generated playlist is designed to match the user's preferences and help the user find the hidden gems that they would usually forget after a week of listening.

For further development, Moodify can be expanded to include additional features such as personalized recommendations based on the user's music preferences, integration with other music streaming services, and a user interface to enhance the user experience. Additionally, Moodify can be extended to support other languages and integrate with other data sources to improve the accuracy of mood analysis.
